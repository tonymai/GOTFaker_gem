        ["I will hurt you for this. A day will come when your joy will turn to ashes and you will know the debt is paid.",
          "A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say? Now, as it happens Marei is quite the spear-handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around us.",
          "Oh, ‘monster.’ Perhaps you should speak to me more softly then. Monsters are dangerous and, just now, kings are dying like flies.",
          "It's not easy being drunk all the time. If it were easy, everyone would do it.",
          "What do I want from you? I want you to share my tent. I want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. I want you to take no other man to bed as long as we're together. And I want you to fu**ck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be.",
          "It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.",
          "I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.",
          "If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.",
          "You once said that without me, the city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?",
          "Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.",
          "I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples and bastards and broken things.",
          "I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I'm guilty of being a dwarf.",
          "The King is a lost cause, it's the rest of us I'm worried about.",
          "Someone threw a cow pie at you so you decide to kill them all! They're starving, you fool! All because of a war you started!",
          "We've had vicious kings, and we've had idiot kings...but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king!",
          "You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead.",
          "When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you're only telling the world that you fear what he might say.",
          "Yes. Until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new king, and my repulsive nephew will be king after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house; wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword, and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much, Jon Snow.",
          "Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you.",
          "Don't fight for a king. Don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor, don't fight for glory, don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in it will be your house that burns. Your gold he steals, your women he rapes. Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them!",
          "I did not kill Joffrey but I wish that I had. Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores. I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it. I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here, so I'll let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat!"].sample

          "A dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words.",
          "People have been swinging at me for years, they always seem to miss.",
          "Anyone who isn't us is our enemy",
          "It's the family name that lives on. That's all that lives on. Not your personal glory, not your honor, but family.",
